Reusable ASP Components
=======================

This section highlights the library of re-usable ASP components provided by
ClORM. The goal is to slowly build up a comprehensive set of components that
could be used to build readable ASP programs that can be easily integrated into
Python applications.

Library components that are currently in the works:

- **date**: Contains definitions and functions for dealing with dates and
  enumerated dates.
- **timeslot**: This library will help to deal with blocks of time; for example
  dividing a day into 15 minute blocks.
